# 80-cereals
*80 cereals* is a dataset which contains nutrition data on 80 different cereal products. The source of the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/80-cereals).

This repository contains the R source code and the report of a simple descriptive statistical analysis performed on the dataset, which includes:

- Calculation of common numerical measures (mean, variance, standard deviation) for each of the nutrients

- Graphical representation of the data, with the use of pie charts, box plots and histograms

- Study of the association between variables (i.e. the nutrients) with tools like Chi-squared, Tschuprow's T, Eta-squared and, ultimately, linear correlation.

The entire report is written in Italian.
