# Spotify Songs Visualization
 Some data visualization about Spotify's most streamed songs using Tableau.

 In this repository you can find the Tableau workbook which includes all the sheets and the two final dashboards.
 
You can also view the dashboards at these two links:

- [Artists Popularity](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/giovanni.cutr./viz/SpotifyMostStreamedSongs-ArtistsPopularity/ArtistsPopularity)
